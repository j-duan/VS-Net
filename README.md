# VS-Net: Variable splitting network for accelerated parallel MRI reconstruction 


The code in this repository implements VS-Net, a model-driven neural network for accelerated parallel MRI reconstruction.+

# Overview
The files in this repository are organized into 3 directories:
* [code](code) : contains base functions for segmentation, co-registration, mesh generation, and motion tracking:
  * code entrance - [code/DMACS.py](code/DMACS.py)
  * deep learning segmentation with the pre-trained model - [code/deepseg.py](code/deepseg.py)
  * co-registration to fit a high-resolution model - [code/p1&2processing.py](demo/p1&2processing.py)
  * fitting meshes to high-resolution model - [code/meshfitting.py](code/meshfitting.py)
  * useful image processing functions used in the pipeline - [code/image_utils.py](code/image_utils.py)
  * downsample mesh resolution while remain its geometry - [code/decimation.py](code/decimation.py)
* [model](model) : contains a tensorflow model pre-trained on ~400 manual annotations on PH patients
* [data](data) : data download address, which contains three sample datasets (4D NIfTI) on which functions from the `code` directory can be run. You should download the data and place them into this folder.

To run the code in the [code](code) directory, we provide a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) image with all the necessary dependencies pre-compiled.
